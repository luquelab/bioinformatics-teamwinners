# Documentations

This [repository](https://github.com/luquelab/bioinformatics-teamwinners) contains a streamlined bioinformatics pipeline developed as part of our Bioinformatics Tools course. The goal of the project was to take a typical, multi-step analysis workflow and polish it into a reproducible, well-documented pipeline that anyone can use or adapt.

Our pipeline focuses on phylogenetic and functional analysis of protein-coding sequences. Starting with a FASTA file of nucleotide sequences, the workflow handles everything from sequence translation and multiple sequence alignment to phylogenetic tree construction and functional annotation using BLAST and HMMER. Along the way, it also provides useful visualizations and summary files to help interpret the [results](https://luquelab.github.io/bioinformatics-teamwinners/gallery/). We've designed the project to be both educational and practical, which is ideal for students learning about comparative genomics or researchers who need a quick way to process and analyze protein sequences. The entire pipeline runs from a single [Jupyter Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/luquelab/bioinformatics-teamwinners/blob/colab_dev/notebooks/sequence_analysis_pipeline.ipynb) and is organized to clearly show each step, with outputs saved in a structured directory format.

Whether you're exploring evolutionary relationships, comparing functional annotations, or just learning how bioinformatics tools fit together, we hope this resource will be useful and easy to build on.
