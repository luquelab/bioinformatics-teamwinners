# ðŸ§¬ Welcome to the Bioinformatics Pipeline by TeamWinners

This GitHub Pages site is linked to our bioinformatics pipeline project, developed as part of our Bioinformatics Tools course. It serves as a central hub for navigating the different components of our GitHub repository. 

The [Documentations page](https://luquelab.github.io/bioinformatics-teamwinners/documentations/) introduces the purpose, structure, and methodology of the pipeline, giving users a clear understanding of what it does and how it works. The [Tutorial section](https://luquelab.github.io/bioinformatics-teamwinners/tutorial/) provides a step-by-step guide for running the pipeline using Google Colab, making it easy for users to follow along and reproduce results. The [Gallery](https://luquelab.github.io/bioinformatics-teamwinners/gallery/) showcases sample outputs, including alignments, functional predictions, organism identification, and phylogenetic trees, giving users a preview of the types of insights the pipeline can generate. Lastly, the [Acknowledgements section](https://luquelab.github.io/bioinformatics-teamwinners/acknowledgements/) credits our team members and instructors, and notes the licensing under which the project is shared.

Whether you're a student, researcher, or educator, we hope this site provides a useful, transparent, and easy-to-follow example of a bioinformatics pipeline in action.

## Project History
This repository was assembled in April 2025.
